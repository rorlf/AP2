/**
* A blue cube can be moved through the scene by clicking it with the right mouse button 
* and moving the mouse. The scene also contains two additional objects:
* A green sphere that changes its colour to red when the cube is touching it.
* A golden cylinder that starts to move when the cube is touching it.
*
* In addition, navigation through the scene is possible using the keyboard.
